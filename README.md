# Welcome to my Human Capital repo! üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This repository contains my codes and routines for the human capital course. In this course we replicate models used in the papers mentioned below:
 * **DHS: Incentives Work: Getting Teachers to Come to School by Esther Duflo, Rema Hanna and Stephen P. Ryan**
      
	In this paper, the authors used a RCT that took place in India in order to study the role of financial incentive in teacher absenteeism. The authors added a structural model to the reduced form approach present in a previous paper. 
  
 * **AMS: Education Choices in Mexico: Using a Structural Model and a Randomized Experiment to Evaluate PROGRESA by Orazio P. Attanasio, Costas Meghir and Ana Santiago**
      
	In this paper, the authors uses the PROGRESSA progam, that took in place in Mexico, to evaluate the impact of the program in the school choice. PROGRESSA is the first conditional cash transfer program established in the world. 
  
Every replication will follow these four steps:
  
**1. Model solution:** 

**2. Simulation:** 

**3. Estimation:** 

**4. Optmal results:**
